# Python-Initial_Level
This repostry contains the basic level of python codes I learned from various book and youtube. I am mentioning some of the resources I found the best.

1. Books - Here are the links : https://python.swaroopch.com/functions.html
2. Youtube - Clever Programmer , Code with Harry.
3. People - If you use Instagram, get connected with Rishi Giri, username - iama_rishi.xyz . The book mentioned above was recommended by him.
 NOTE: Do not learn from many resources at once , it will frustrate you , stick to one or at max two and do complete them whole once.  
Here are some links for practice : https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php
